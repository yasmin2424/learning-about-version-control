# **Learning about Version Control**

Author: **Yasmin Hassan**

Solving merge conflicts is soooooo hard!

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

I love how version control helps me keep track of changes and collaborate with others.Very important tool in the field

I find resolving merge conflicts and understanding branching strategies the most frustrating. Am still not okay to say i fully understand it.
